# bar_restaurant_template
In this template I have created a template as well as a first prototype for Froogle. While as an intern there I need to make websites for various businesses. This first template is of a bar_restaurant template in that order. This template was made in ReactJS and NodeJs. The app is currently static. It probably will remain static forevor. The current framework of React is not necessarilly optimized for static websites. I plan on switching to gatsby when I have time. 

TO DO 
1. Set up Heroku Link
2. Try to set up in Gatsby Framework.
3. Set up a google maps API or other maps service
